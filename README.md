## Trivia Game 

A Football trivia gamed designed o test your knowledge in the NFL. 
Here in this application we present 10 questions to the user using arrays of question answers and correct answers.
In this project I strived to create an easy on the eye visual experience while adding some flavor with a dynamic scoring options that is explained below.


### Game Rules
The user has the ability to select from 4 options. 
Everytime the user selects the correct add .nswer first try they are rewarded 100 points.
Clicking 1 wrong answer followed by the correct answer awards 50 points. 
Clicking 2 wrong answers followed by the correct answer awards 25 points.

### Functions
This program implements a function for clicking the next question, a function for resetting the game and also a trigger function that check to see when the last question has been reached and makes the final score a larger visual for the user to see clearly.
